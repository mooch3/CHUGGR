# CHUGGR
CHUGGR is a social media app that allows friends to connect over sports and beverages from wherever they are in the world. It is light-hearted application that provides a fun user experience that includes realtime chats, user authentication, friends, follows, and sports betting. Currently, the application is in production as I look for ways to implement the latest frameworks to create a seemless user experience. When deployed, a link will be included in this README for users to sign up. This application is also available for iOS.

Keep CHUGGIN'.

This project is maintained by Derek Smith (Web) and Daniel Luo (iOS).
